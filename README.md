## 📌 Overview

This project is my submission for the **"30 Days SQL Micro Course"**, a hands-on program aimed at mastering SQL through real-world scenarios. The assignment uses a hospital dataset and challenges participants to extract meaningful insights using structured queries.

All queries were written and executed in **PostgreSQL**, and the final results were compiled into a professional report for certification.
